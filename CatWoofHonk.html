										<h4 id="content">In the 2016 NBA GM survey, executives were asked to identify a player who would likely have a breakout season the following year. The four leading responses were for Devin Booker, Karl-Anthony Towns, Myles Turner, and D'Angelo Russell (tied with Andrew Wiggins). Of those players, all but Russell and Wiggins have stayed with their drafted teams; fittingly, Russell and Wiggins were mostly recently involved in a deal at the 2020 trade deadline.</br></br> 


										The Timberwolves' trade for Russell merits a few emoji eyes. Readers might recall Slam's NBA preview edition from the fall, in which Russell brazenly suggested that he, Booker, and Towns would one day play on the same team. Speculation about the three 2015 NBA draft class alums joining up in Minnesota has begun to brew, meshing well with the Timberwolves' post-deadline mirth following the team's resounding win over the Clippers on Saturday.</br></br> 

										Trepidation over Russell's fit is not unmerited. The Timberwolves' recent progression of lead ballhandlers — from Ricky Rubio to Jeff Teague, and now Russell — suggests an increasing foray towards ball dominance. How might Russell's playstyle mesh with Towns, the team's franchise player? Below is a visualization of their shooting splits so far into the 2019-20 season.</br></h4>
